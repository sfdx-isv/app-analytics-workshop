All good things come to an end, right?  In the case of your first scratch org, we're going to accellerate the process and delete it right now.

**In this exercise, you will...**

* Use the Salesforce CLI to delete your scratch org
* Use the `clear` command to keep your terminal easy-to-read

## Use the Salesforce CLI to delete your scratch org
When you delete a scratch org, you'll want to be specific about which one you want to delete.  You can do that with the `force:org:delete` command by using the `-u` flag.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:org:delete -u PkgScratch
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:delete`              | Marks a scratch org for deletion.                       |
| `-u (targetusername)`           | A username or alias for the target org.                 |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

1. The `force:org:delete` command.
2. The CLI asking you to confirm that you really want to delete the `PkgScratch` org.
3. A message stating that the org was successfully marked for deletion.

## Use the `clear` command to keep your terminal easy-to-read
This is a handy commmand that works in MacOS, Windows, and Linux.  Use it to remove old lines from your terminal display if things start feeling too crowded.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
clear
```
**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
