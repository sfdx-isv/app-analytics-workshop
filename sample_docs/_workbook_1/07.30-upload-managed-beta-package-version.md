**In this exercise, you will...**

* Use `force:package1:version:list` to see a list of Package Versions associated with your packaging org
* Prepare to use the `force:package1:version:create` command
* Use `force:package1:version:create` to upload a "Managed Beta" version of your package
* View the newly uploaded Package Version in your packaging org

## Use `force:package1:version:list` to see a list of Package Versions associated with your packaging org

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:package1:version:list -u PkgOrg
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:package1:version:list`   | Lists the versions for the specified package or all first-generation packages in the org. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

## Prepare to use the `force:package1:version:create` command
It can be a bit tricky to get the `force:package1:version:create` command right, so here is an alternative way of setting up the command that might be helpful.

**Step 1 of 4: Create a new untitled file in VS Code**

1. Press **command+shift+P** (MacOS) or **CTRL+SHIFT+P** (Windows) to open the VS Code command pallete.
2. In the search box, type "new unt".
3. Click the **File: New Untitled File** command.

**Step 2 of 4: Copy this command to your clipboard**
```bash
sfdx force:package1:version:create \
    -i YOUR_033_METADATAPACKAGE_ID \
    -n "Winter 2019" \
    -v "1.1" \
    -d "Managed beta release. Uploaded via the CLI" \
    -u PkgOrg \
    -w 15
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:package1:version:create` | Creates a first-generation package version in the release org. |
| `-i (--packageid)`              | ID of the metadata package (starts with 033) of which youâ€™re creating a new version. |
| `-n (--name)`                   | Package version name.                                   |
| `-v (--version)`                | Package version in major.minor format, for example, 3.2.|
| `-d (--description)`            | Package version description.                            |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |
| `-w (--wait)`                   | Minutes to wait for the package version to be created. The default is 2 minutes. |

**Step 3 of 4: Paste the command into your new untitled file**
