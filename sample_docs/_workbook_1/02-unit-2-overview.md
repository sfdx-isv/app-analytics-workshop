The Salesforce CLI is a "Command Line Interface" tool. That means that it's a program that you can use from your terminal, shell, or command prompt.

This unit will walk you through the basics of running commands with the Salesforce CLI.  You'll connect your CLI to your Developer Hub org and your Packaging Org. You'll also run some basic commands that will help you learn about some of the limits associated with Salesforce DX.
