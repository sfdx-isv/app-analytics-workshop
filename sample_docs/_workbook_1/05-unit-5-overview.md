You're now set up exactly like an ISV with an in-market app would be.  You've got a packaging org, a package with a Managed-Released version, and an app that needs some work to become more useful to your users.

This unit will walk you through the process of retrieving your package's metadata from your packaging org, unpacking the retrieved code, and then converting it into the Salesforce DX Source format.
