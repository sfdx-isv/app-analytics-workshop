**In this exercise, you will...**

* Use the CLI to push your SFDX source into your scratch org
* Use the CLI to open your scratch org

## Use the CLI to push your SFDX source into your scratch org
Before you can build your app, you have to get it's source into a scratch org.  While with MDAPI source you have to **deploy source** to an org, if you're using SFDX source and a scratch org, you can use a **source push**.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:source:push
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:source:push`             | Pushes changed source from your project to a scratch org to keep them in sync. |


**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

1. The `force:source:push` command that you just executed.
2. A list of the SFDX source files that were pushed to the scratch org.

## Use the CLI to open your scratch org
Just like you've done several times before, use `force:org:open` to open your scratch org.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:org:open
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:open`                | Opens an org in your browser.                           |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U06_vscode-cli-scratch-org-open-successful.png" alt="" caption="" %}

**Your default browser should automatically open to Setup Home within the scratch org:**
