## Delete the `profiles` directory from your SFDX source
Since you don't want to include profiles in your managed package, you'll need to get rid of them before converting your code back from SFDX source to MDAPI source.

**Step 1 of 2: Use the context menu to delete the `profiles` directory**

1. In the VS Code Explorer, right-click on the `force-app/main/default/profiles` directory.
2. Select the **Delete** menu item.
