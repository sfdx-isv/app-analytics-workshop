**In this exercise, you will...**

* Create a new scratch org (`PkgTest`) to use as an install target for your Managed Beta package
* Use the CLI to install your Managed Beta package in your `PkgTest` scratch org
* Use the CLI to assign the `Travel_Expenses_User` permission set to your scratch org user
* Open your `PkgTest` scratch org to see the Travel Expenses App in action

## Create a new scratch org (`PkgTest`) to use as an install target for your Managed Beta package

**Warning:** This version of `force:org:create` is slightly different from the other ones you've used.  This time, you're adding the `-n (--nonamespace)` flag to prevent this scratch org from being created as a Namespaced Scratch org. <br> <br> **If you forget to add this flag, you'll get an error** when you try to install your managed package because the package's namespace would be in conflict with the namespace being used by the scratch org.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:org:create -a PkgTest -n -f config/project-scratch-def.json
```

| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:create`              | Description TBA                                         |
| `-a (--setalias)`               | Sets an alias for for the created scratch org. |
| `-n (--nonamespace)`            | Creates the scratch org with no namespace. Useful when using a scratch org to test installations of packages with namespaces. |
| `-f (--definitionfile)`         | Path to a scratch org definition file.  |


**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

## Use the CLI to install your Managed Beta package in your `PkgTest` scratch org
Your're ready to install your Managed-Beta package version in your new `PkgTest` scratch org, but to do so you'll need to know the **Package Version ID**. Luckily, you can get this from another call to `force:package1:version:list`.

**Step 1 of 2: Use `force:package1:version:list` to get the Package Version ID of your Managed Beta package**

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:package1:version:list -u PkgOrg
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:package1:version:list`   | Lists the versions for the specified package or all first-generation packages in the org. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

1. Make note of the `METADATAPACKAGEVERSIONID` value for the v1.1.0 Beta package.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U07_vscode-cli-package-list-with-managed-beta-package.png" alt="" caption="" %}


**Step 2 of 2: Use `force:package:install` to install your package into the `PkgTest` org**


**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:package:install \
    -p YOUR_04t_PACKAGE_VERSION_ID \
    -u PkgTest \
    -w 15
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:package:install`         | Installs a package in the target org. |
| `-p (--package)`                | The ID (starts with 04t) or alias of the package version to install. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |
| `-w (--wait)`                   | Maximum number of minutes to wait for installation status. The default is 0. |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

1. The Package Version ID from the `force:package1:version:list` command is copied...
2. And is pasted into the `force:package:install` command.

## Use the CLI to assign the "Travel Expenses User" permission set to your scratch org user
The CLI can do more than just deploy/retrieve and push/pull metadata.  You can also do things like assign permission sets via the CLI.

**Step 1 of 2: Determine the API name of the "Travel Expenses User" permission set**

1. Look at the name of the metadata file for the **Travel Expenses User** permission set.
2. You'll use the first half (everything to the left of `.permissionset`) in your next command.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U07_vscode-cli-assign-permission-set-wide-view.png" alt="" caption="" %}


**Step 2 of 2: Use `force:user:permset:assign` to assign the permission set**

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:user:permset:assign -u PkgTest -n "Travel_Expenses_User"
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:user:permset:assign`     | Assigns a named permission set to one or more users of an org. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |
| `-n (--permsetname)`            | The name of the permission set to assign. |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U07_vscode-cli-assign-permission-set-success.png" alt="" caption="" %}


## Open your `PkgTest` scratch org to see the Travel Expenses App in action

**Step 1 of 3: Execute this command**
```bash
sfdx force:org:open -u PkgTest
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:org:open`                | Opens an org in your browser.                           |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |

**After executing the above, your default browser will automatically open to the `PkgTest` scratch org and your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U07_pkgtest-verify-travel-expenses-app-available-00.png" alt="" caption="" %}

**Step 2 of 3: From inside your `PkgTest` scratch org, launch the "Travel Expenses" app**

1. Verify that you're in the PkgTest org.
2. Open the App Launcher.
3. Type "Travel Exp" in the search box.
4. Click on the **Travel Expenses** app.

**Step 3 of 3: Create a Travel Expense Record**

From here, go ahead and add a new Travel Expense record to prove that everything works.  Remember, this is not local code.  It's a managed package that you installed in the org, just like an ISV would do.
