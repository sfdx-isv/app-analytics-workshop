* Use `force:mdapi:retrieve` to get a local copy of the metadata from your packaging org

## Use `force:mdapi:retrieve` to get a local copy of the metadata from your packaging org
Before you can use Salesforce DX to develop your app, you'll need to retrieve your package's metadata.  The `force:mdapi:retrieve` command can help you do this.

**Important:** When you copy/paste the following command, remember to replace `"My Managed Package"` with the name (not the *namespace*, but the **name**) of your managed package.  If you use the incorrect name, or make a mistake, the `force:mdapi:retrieve` command will not work as expected.
{: .notice--warning}


**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:mdapi:retrieve \
    -u PkgOrg \
    -p "My Managed Package" \
    -r mdapi-source \
    -w 10 \
    -s
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags   | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:mdapi:retrieve`          | Uses Metadata API to retrieve a .zip of XML files that represent metadata from the targeted org. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`         | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |
| `-p (--packagenames)`           | A comma-separated list of package names to retrieve.   |
| `-r (--retrievetargetdir)`      | The root of the directory structure where the retrieved .zip or metadata files are put. |
| `-w (--wait)`                   | The number of minutes to wait for the command to complete. |
| `-s (--singlepackage)`          | Specifies whether only a single package is being retrieved (true) or more than one package (false). |


**While your package is being retrieved, your terminal should look something like this:**

**After your package is retrieved, VS Code should look something like this:**

1. The CLI will show a **Result** message giving you the status of the retrieval.
2. A new file, `unpackaged.zip` will appear inside of a new directory, `mdapi-source`.
