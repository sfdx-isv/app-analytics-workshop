Rather than bounce back-and-forth between VS Code and your **Terminal** or **PowerShell** app, you can use the VS Code integrated terminal to make things easier.

**In this exercise, you will...**

* Use the VS Code command pallete to execute `View: Toggle Panel`
* Test the VS Code integrated terminal by using a simple shell command


## Use the VS Code command pallete to execute `View: Toggle Panel`
Inside VS Code, Press `COMMAND+SHIFT+P` (or `CTRL+SHIFT+P` on Windows) to open the VS Code command pallette, then...

1. Type the word `panel` into the search box next to the `>` character.
2. Find the **View: Toggle Panel** item and click it.

## Test the VS Code integrated terminal by using a simple shell command

**Execute this command inside the VS Code integrated terminal:**
```bash
ls -l
```
**Follow these instructions when executing the above command:**

1. Click on the TERMINAL tab in the VS Code developer panel.
2. Inside of the terminal window, type the `ls -l` command and hit ENTER.
3. The output of the command should look very similar to what you saw previously when you ran the `ls -l` command in your system's terminal application window.
