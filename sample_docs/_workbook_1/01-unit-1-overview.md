The Developer Hub, or "Dev Hub", is a critical part of the Salesforce DX toolset, enabling you to create and manage scratch orgs from the command line.  

This unit will ensure that you have access to a Dev Hub and walk you through the process of linking a packaging org to your Dev Hub.


<!--
### Log in to your Developer Hub
Check that you have access to a Developer Hub, and start learning why ISV Partners should use the Developer Hub that's part of their Partner Business Org (PBO).

### Register your packaging org's namespace
Link your packaging org to your Developer Hub so you can build namespaced scratch orgs, something that is very specific to how ISV Partners use Salesforce DX.
