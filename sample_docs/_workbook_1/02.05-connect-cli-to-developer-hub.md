In this exercise, you will...

* Open your system's terminal/shell program (the "command line")
* Make sure the Salesforce CLI is installed
* Authenticate the CLI to your Developer Hub

## Open your system's terminal/shell program (the "command line")
In order to use the Salesforce CLI, you need to get to a "command line" on your local machine.

* MacOS users should use the **Terminal** app (or something similar like **iTerm**)
* Windows users should use **PowerShell** if possible, though the **Commannd Prompt** (cmd.exe) will also work 

## Make sure the Salesforce CLI is installed
**NOTE:** As of May 29, 2019, the `sfdx force --version` command has been removed from the CLI. To complete this step, please use `sfdx plugins --core` to ensure that your CLI is installed correctly.

Let's start with a simple command that will help make sure that the Salesforce CLI is installed and running OK on your machine.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force --version
```
**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**

## Authenticate the CLI to your Developer Hub
The Salesforce CLI can't do anything interesting until you've connected it to your Developer Hub.  To do that you'll use the `force:auth:web:login` command.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a DevHub
```
