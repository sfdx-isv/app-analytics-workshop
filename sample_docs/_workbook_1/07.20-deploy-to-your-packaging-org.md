## Verify that the new components you deployed were automatically added to your package
Open up your Packaging Org again and enter setup to take the following steps.

1. In **Setup**, click on the **Home** tab.
2. Type "package" in the Quick Find box.
3. Click the **Package Manager** menu item.
4. Make sure you click into the Package Detail page for `My Managed Package` (or whatever your package's name is)
5. Review the metadata components that are currently in your package.  Note that the new components were added automatically as part of the deploy because you had included the package name as part of the deployment.
