* View help for the `force:limits` command topic
* View help for the `force:limits:api:display` command
* Check the API limits in your Developer Hub org

## Use the Salesforce CLI built-in help to see the list of `force` command topics
The Salesforce CLI has a lot of **topics** and **commands**.  The CLI's built-in help system makes it easy to find out what commands are available and how to call them.

**Jargon Alert!** With the Salesforce CLI, **commands** are things that you execute via the CLI.  **Topics** are like folders that hold commands (and even other topics!).  All of this helps make the commands implemented by the CLI easier to find and rember.

**To get top-level help for the `force` topic, execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx help force
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `help`                            | Special documentation command that provides help for the topic or command that follows it. |
| `force`                           | Top-level topic that contains all the topics and commands that are part of the core Salesforce DX plugin library. |

**Your CLI Screen Should Look Something Like This:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U02_cli-sfdx-help-force-result.png" alt="" caption="" %}

## View help for the `force:limits` topic

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx help force:limits
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `help`                            | Special documentation command that provides help for the topic or command that follows it. |
| `force:limits`                    | Topic containing commands for inspecting various org-based limits |

**Your CLI Screen Should Look Something Like This:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U02_cli-sfdx-help-force-limits-result.png" alt="" caption="" %}

## View help for the `force:limits:api:display` command
Until now, you've been using the `help` command followed by the command or topic we wanted to learn about.  You can also add the `-h` or `--help` flags to any command to get the same result.

**Execute this command using the `-h` flag to see the built-in help for it:**
```bash
sfdx force:limits:api:display -h
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:limits:api:display`        | Displays remaining and maximum calls and events for your org. |
| `-h (--help)`                     | Special flag available on all topics and commands. Instead of prepending your command with `help`, you can add the `-h` flag to open help for that command |

**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U02_cli-sfdx-help-force-limits-api-display-result.png" alt="" caption="" %}

## Check the API limits in your Developer Hub org
Now that you've seen the help on how to use it, go ahead and execute the `force:limits:api:display` command against your DevHub to see it's API limits usage.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:limits:api:display -u DevHub
```

| Salesforce DX Command / Flags     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------|
| `force:limits:api:display`        | Displays remaining and maximum calls and events for your org. |
| `-u (--targetusername)`           | A username or alias for the target org. Overrides the default target org. |

**Your CLI Screen Should Look Something Like This:**

**Important Note:** Dev Hub orgs have two special limits: **ActiveScratchOrgs** and **DailyScratchOrgs**.<br>"Active" scratch orgs are the total number of scratch orgs that you can create and leave existing at one time.<br>"Daily" scratch orgs reflects the number of times each day that you can create a new scratch org.
