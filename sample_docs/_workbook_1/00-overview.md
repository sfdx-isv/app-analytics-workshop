### UNIT 1: Developer Hub Fundamentals (~10 minutes)
This unit will ensure that you have access to a Dev Hub and walk you through the process of linking a packaging org to your Dev Hub.

### UNIT 2: Salesforce CLI Fundamentals (~15 minutes)
This unit will walk you through the basics of running commands with the Salesforce CLI.  You'll connect your CLI to your Developer Hub org and your Packaging Org. You'll also run some basic commands that will help you learn about some of the limits associated with Salesforce DX.

### UNIT 3: Salesforce DX Project Fundamentals (~20 minutes)
This unit will walk you through the process of creating a Salesforce DX project and opening that project in Visual Studio Code.  The unit closes with the creation (and destruction!) of your first scratch org.

### UNIT 4: Prepare Your Managed Package for Development (~10 minutes)
This unit will walk you through the process of logging into your Packaging Org with the CLI and creating a very simple managed package. You'll then be able to use this managed package with the units and exercises that come later in this workbook.

### UNIT 5: Convert Your Managed Package to Salesforce DX (~10 minutes)
This unit will walk you through the process of retrieving your package's metadata from your packaging org, unpacking the retrieved code, and then converting it into the Salesforce DX Source format.

### UNIT 6: Develop Your Managed Package in a Scratch Org (~20 minutes)
This unit will walk you through the typical Salesforce DX development lifecycle.  In it you'll create a scratch org, push SFDX source to it, make declarative changes to your app, then pull those changes back into your local project files.

### UNIT 7: Update, Upload, and Install Your Managed Package (~20 minutes)
In this final unit, you'll learn how an ISV Partner can use Salesforce DX to "close the circle" by getting your updated code back into your packaging org, and even uploading it as a new managed package version.
