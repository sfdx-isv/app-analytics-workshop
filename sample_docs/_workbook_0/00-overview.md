There are are several pre-workshop activities that students **must** complete before the hands-on activities can be attempted.

* Download and configure local tools like Git, the Salesforce CLI, and VS Code
* Get access to a Developer Hub org (preferably in your Partner Business Org)
* Create a brand new packaging org (**do not** use an existing packaging org!)

The documentation in this section will help you complete these prerequisites.
