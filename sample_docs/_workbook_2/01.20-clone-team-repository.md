**In this exercise, you will...**

* Clone the `travel-expenses` Team Repository from GitHub
* Open the `travel-expenses` project in VS Code

## Clone the `travel-expenses` Team Repository on GitHub

**Note:** You are free to clone this project anywhere you'd like on your local machine, but the best place to put it is in the `sfdx-workshop` directory that you created in Workshop One.
{: .notice--info}

**Execute this command inside your `sfdx-workshop` directory:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfdx-isv/travel-expenses.git
```
<!--
**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U05_vscode-convert-mdapi-source-results.png" alt="" caption="" %}
-->

## Open the `travel-expenses` project in VS Code

Once you've cloned the `travel-expenses` repository from GitHub, open that folder inside VS Code.

Just like you did in Workshop One, you will use the integrated terminal in VS Code for the remainder of the exercises in this workbook.
