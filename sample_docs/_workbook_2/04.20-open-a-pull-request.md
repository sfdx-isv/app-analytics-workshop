**In this exercise, you will...**

* Create a pull request to get the code from your branch into `master`

## Create a pull request to get the code from your branch into `master`
Open the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/sfdx-isv/travel-expenses/pulls) on the `sfdx-isv/travel-expenses` respository on GitHub.

1. Click the **New pull request** button
2. Make sure that the **base** (the one on the left) is set to `master` and the **compare** (the one on the right) is set to **your** branch.
3. After selecting your branch as the "compare" branch, you should see a large, green, **Create pull request** button.  If you see it, click it.  If you don't, it means that your changes are in conflict with someone else's.
4. On the next screen, you'll be asked to leave a comment explaining why you want to merge your code into master.  Fill this out with a brief message, then click the big, green **Create Pull Request** button again.

Don't worry if you see what looks like an error message at this point.  You're seeing it because commits to the master branch are restricted.  The instructor will use one of the student's pull request as an example in the final unit.
