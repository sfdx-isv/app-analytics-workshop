**In this exercise, you will...**

* Build a small feature of your choice into the Travel Expenses app
* Perform a Source Push (or Pull), depending on what you built

## Build a small feature of your choice into the Travel Expenses app
For this exercise, build any sort of feature into the Travel Expenses app that you like.

Adding an additional custom field to the Travel Expense object is a quick, easy way to complete this step.  You're free to use your imagination if something different strikes you!

## Perform a Source Push (or Pull), depending on what you built
Once you've built your feature, you'll either need to get it **into** or **out of** your scratch org.

**Execute this command if you built your feature declaratively:**
```bash
sfdx force:source:pull
```

**Execute this command if you built your feature using VS Code (eg. you added or modified an Apex class):**
```bash
sfdx force:source:push
```

<!--
**After executing the above, your terminal should look something like this:**
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/W01_U05_vscode-convert-mdapi-source-results.png" alt="" caption="" %}
