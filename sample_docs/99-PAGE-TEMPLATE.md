* We will cover this

## We will cover this
One or two sentences that give a simple overview of what the student is being asked to do.

**Execute this command:**
```bash
sfdx force:source:convert \
    -r ./sfdx-source/package-dir \
    -o ./mdapi-source/mdapi-dir \
    -p "My Package Name"
```

| `force:source:convert`          | Description TBA                                         |
| `-r (--rootdir)`                | Description TBA                                         |
| `-o (--outputdir)`              | Description TBA                                         |
