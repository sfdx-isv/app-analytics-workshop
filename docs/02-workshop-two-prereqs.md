## Step One: Install Git (Required)

**Why?** Git is an incredibly popular and widely used VCS (version control system).  Salesforce has standardized on Git for all of our examples where a VCS is used.  Salesforce DX and Git are like chocolate and peanut butter. :-)

* First, check if you already have Git installed
    * Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
         `git --version`
    * You should see something like (yours doesn't have to be exactly like this, just similar)
        `git version 2.17.1 (Apple Git-112)`
    * If you get any sort of error, then you probably _do not_ have Git installed on your machine.  If this is the case, follow the rest of the instructions to install Git.
* Visit [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* Follow **all three** of the steps listed under “Setting up Git”

## Step Two: Create a GitHub Account (Required)

**Why?** We will be pulling and pushing source from/to a GitHub Repository.  You'll need a GitHub account to walk through some of the team collaboration features.

* Visit [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to create your account
    * **IMPORTANT:** Your GitHub account may end up becoming an important part of your online brand.  Choose an appropriate, professional username.  FirstnameMLastname is a good pattern to follow (eg. VivekMChawla)
    * **IMPORTANT:** Use your PERSONAL email address.  There's nothing wrong with using your work email, I just think it's a good idea that your GitHub account represents YOU, regardless of where you currently work. 

## Step Three: Complete the “Git and GitHub Basics” Trailhead Module (Recommended)

**Why?** This module will help you learn about version control systems and practice using Git and GitHub, both of which will feature heavily in the content and exercises in workshop two.
{: .notice--success}

* **Trailhead Module:** [Git and GitHub Basics](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/sfdx_get_started/modules/git-and-git-hub-basics)
* **Time Required:** 1hr 50mins
* It is strongly recommended that you complete this Trailhead module before attempting to certify that you've completed the prerequisites.

## FINAL STEP: Certify That You Have Completed the PreRequisites (Required)

**Why?** The Prerequisite Certification Process will ensure that you have a valid GitHub account and that you've correctly installed and configured Git on your local machine.  Students who complete the pre-requisites will be added to a team Developer Hub and will be added as collaborators to the shared project repository that will be used for the hands-on exercises during Day Two of the workshop.
{: .notice--success}

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not complete the Prerequisite Certification Process, **you will not be able to follow along** with the hands-on exercises during the workshop.

* Follow the instructions in this document: [Prerequisite Certification: SFDX for ISVs (Workshop Two)](https://github.com/sfdx-isv/travel-expenses/blob/master/README.md)
    * **IMPORTANT:** Making sure that Git is setup correctly on your local machine can be tricky.  It is **strongly** advised that you try to complete this step as soon as possible and reach out for help if you get stuck.
* After you complete the **Prerequisite Certification Process** from the previous step, a Salesforce User account will be created for you in the workshop leader's Developer Hub.
    * You should receive a “new user” email approximately 12 - 24 hours after completing the Prerequisite Certification
    * If you don't receive your “new user” email, please email your workshop leader.
