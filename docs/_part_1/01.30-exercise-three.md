## Verify that the final dashboard is available

1. Select the ‘SAMPLE DF19 App Analytics’ dashboard.

2. Verify that dashboard opens in subtab with data showing. (note that since org has just been created, you may see ‘Widget cannot be displayed’ - just refresh the page)

You can close the dashboard subtab after review
