We are going to request the scratch org that will be used for the workshop exercises. We will also verify that it works and save login information.

### Exercise 1: Request a Hands-on Org
You will navigate to the org request page to provision the scratch org.

### Exercise 2: Save Your Login Info
Since the scratch org is available for 30 days, this will allow you to log in and use it after the workshop.
