Here we’ll group our chart by customer then measure by unique users, enabling you to then sort and visualize the top users.

* Measure by unique users
* Sort users
* Save the lens

## Group by Account
Now since we want to see who are our top customers, let’s group by Account.  (Since we joined LMA data in this org we can use Account instead of just Subscriber Org Id to provide richer data). 


1. In the "Bars" section on the left, click the + to add a group
2. And search for Account 
3. Select ```LMA.Account__c.Name```

Now the chart will show the rows data grouped by your subscribers (ie. Account)

## Measure by the Number of Users

In the "Bar Length" section - 
1. Click on the "Count of Rows" 
(Note: click the name and not the downward facing arrow) 
2. Select "Unique" from the left hand side (last option) 
3. Search for ```user_id_token``` 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/P2_U1_E2_unique-users" alt="" caption="" %}

<!-- -------------------- TASK BOUNDARY -------------------- -->

## Sort Users
Click on the downward arrow beside "Unique of user_id_token" and select "Sort Descending"
