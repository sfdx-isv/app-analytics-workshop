We’ll get started with creating a new lens in Einstein Analytics from the data set. Think of a lens as a report - it’s just a simple query against the dataset. 

**In this exercise, you will...**

* Use the existing dataset ‘log-lma’
* Create a new lens

## Create a New Lens

After selecting the dataset, you’ll get a new tab for a New Lens. 

This gives us a lens containing all of our data.
