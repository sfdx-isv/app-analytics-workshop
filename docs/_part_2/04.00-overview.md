In this last step weâ€™ll create a dashboard containing some of the visualizations to add to your LMA-DF 19 project. This will help our business and sales teams get an overview of our app.

### EXERCISE 1: Create an Empty Dashboard
We will create an empty dashboard that will gather our lens visualizations.

### EXERCISE 2: Clip Lenses to the Dashboard
Clipping a lens is similar to copy and paste. You take a snapshot of each lens that then is available in the dashboard designer.


### EXERCISE 3: Customize and Save Your Dashboard
We will add section headers and drag and position our lens clips to give an overall picture of our application.
